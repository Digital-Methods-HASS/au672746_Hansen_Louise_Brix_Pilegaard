###2) use the rvest library to scrape data of your interest (football statistics in Wikipedia?, gender representatives in different governments? global population by country in https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/ )


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# installing packages
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(stringr)
library(janitor)
```


### Adapting the web-scraping pipeline from the police-killings markdown

```{r}
# getting the url and scraping the website
url <- "https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/"
url_html <- read_html(url)
```


```{r}
whole_table <- url_html %>% 
 html_nodes("table") %>%
 html_table()  
head(whole_table)

new_table <- do.call(cbind,unlist(whole_table, recursive = FALSE)) 

df <- as.data.frame(new_table)

head(df)
```

### cleaning the df (only the columns of interest)

```{r}
# cleaning some columns in the df and changing their names
clean_df <- df %>%
  mutate(population = as.numeric(gsub(",","", df$`Population (2020)`))) %>% # remove commas
  mutate(yearly_change = as.numeric(gsub("%","", df$`Yearly Change`))) %>% # remove %
  mutate(density_per_sqr_km = as.numeric(gsub(",","", df$`Density (P/KmÂ²)`))) %>%
  mutate(country = `Country (or dependency)`) %>% 
  select("country", "population", "yearly_change", "density_per_sqr_km")

head(clean_df)
```

### exploring the data with a plot

```{r}
# only looking at the 15 most populated countries
short_df <- arrange(clean_df, desc(population))[1:15, ] 

# removing scientific notation
options(scipen = 100)
```


```{r}
# plotting density against yearly change in population size
ggplot(short_df, aes(x = density_per_sqr_km, y = yearly_change, color = country, label = country, size = population)) +
  geom_point()+
  geom_text(size = 3, position = position_jitter(height = 0.25))+
  theme_bw()+
  scale_colour_discrete(guide = "none")+ # remove the 'country' legend
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1))+
  labs(x = "Population density per square kilometer", y = "Yearly change in population size")+
  ggtitle("Density plotted against yearly change, 15 biggest countries")
```
